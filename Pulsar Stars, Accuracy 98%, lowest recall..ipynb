What I mean is, our classes are extremely unbalanced, if we only care about accuracy and obtain high rate of false negatives, it means that our network is not performing well on what it was created for. \n\nWhat I did here was tuning the parameters of the network to obtain the least rate of false negatives while increasing accuracy. The drawback of this approach was that as the false negative occurrencies decreased so increased the occurencies of false positives. In a real worl context, this means that we are better at classifying Pulsar stars, meanwhile our network fails more in classify a Non-pulsar Star as a Pulsar Star (There's no free lunch, you know). Particularly, this behavior is worth because we will be predicting better at what the classifier was meant for.
